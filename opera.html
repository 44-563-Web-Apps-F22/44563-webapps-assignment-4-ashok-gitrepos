            <p class="speech"><h6 class="name Alexis">ALEXIS.</h6>
     I rejoice that it's decided,
                Happy now will be his life,
           For my father is provided
                With a true and tender wife.
           She will tend him, nurse him, mend him,
                Air his linen, dry his tears;
           Bless the thoughtful fate that send him
                Such a wife to soothe his years!
              </p>

              <p class="speech"><h6 class="name Aline">ALINE.</h6>
          No young giddy thoughtless maiden,
                Full of graces, airs, and jeers—
           But a sober widow, laden
                With the weight of fifty years!
             </p>

             <p class="speech"><h6 class="name SirM">SIR M.</h6>
            No high-born exacting beauty
                Blazing like a jewelled sun—
           But a wife who'll do her duty,
                As that duty should be done!
             </p>
             <p class="speech"><h6 class="name MrsP">MRS. P.</h6>
          I'm no saucy minx and giddy—
                Hussies such as them abound—
           But a clean and tidy widdy
                Well be-known for miles around!
             </p>
             <p class="speech"><h6 class="name DrD">DR.D.</h6>
           All the village now have mated,
                All are happy as can be—
           I to live alone am fated:
                No one's left to marry me!
             </p>

    looks after them sentimentally, then exits with a sigh.)<br>
      Enter Mr. Wells</p>

     Oh, I have wrought much evil with my spells!<br>
           And ill I can't undo!<br>
     This is too bad of you, J. W. Wells—<br>
           What wrong have they done you?<br>
     And see—another love-lorn lady comes—<br>
           Alas, poor stricken dame!<br>
     A gentle pensiveness her life benumbs—<br>
           And mine, alone, the blame!<br>
         </p>
<p class="directions">
  Lady Sangazure enters.  She is very melancholy</p>
  <p class="speech"><h6 class="name LadyS">LADY S.</h6>
         Alas, ah me! and well-a-day!
           I sigh for love, and well I may,
           For I am very old and grey.
                But stay!

        <h3>The Sorcerer</h3>
        <h5>ACT II
            Scene—Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's mansion by moonlight.  All the
            peasantry are discovered asleep on the ground, as at the end of
            Act I.
            <br>
          
            Enter Mr. Wells, on tiptoe, followed by Alexis and Aline. Mr. Wells
            carries a dark lantern.</h5>
            <p>
                ALEXIS.           I rejoice that it's decided,
                Happy now will be his life,
           For my father is provided
                With a true and tender wife.
           She will tend him, nurse him, mend him,
                Air his linen, dry his tears;
           Bless the thoughtful fate that send him
                Such a wife to soothe his years!
                <br>

ALINE.            No young giddy thoughtless maiden,
                Full of graces, airs, and jeers—
           But a sober widow, laden
                With the weight of fifty years!
                <br>

SIR M.            No high-born exacting beauty
                Blazing like a jewelled sun—
           But a wife who'll do her duty,
                As that duty should be done!
                <br>
MRS. P.           I'm no saucy minx and giddy—
                Hussies such as them abound—
           But a clean and tidy widdy
                Well be-known for miles around!
                <br>
DR.D.             All the village now have mated,
                All are happy as can be—
           I to live alone am fated:
                No one's left to marry me!
                <br>
ENSEMBLE.              She will tend him etc.

(Exeunt Sir Marmaduke, Mrs. Partlet, and Aline, with Alexis.  Dr.
Daly
looks after them sentimentally, then exits with a sigh.)

                 Enter Mr. Wells

              RECITATIVE—MR. WELLS

     Oh, I have wrought much evil with my spells!
           And ill I can't undo!
     This is too bad of you, J. W. Wells—
           What wrong have they done you?
     And see—another love-lorn lady comes—
           Alas, poor stricken dame!
     A gentle pensiveness her life benumbs—
           And mine, alone, the blame!

  Lady Sangazure enters.  She is very melancholy
  <br>
LADY S.           Alas, ah me! and well-a-day!
           I sigh for love, and well I may,
           For I am very old and grey.
                But stay!

 (Sees Mr. Wells, and becomes fascinated by him.)

                    RECITATIVE
                    <br>
LADY S.     What is this fairy form I see before me?
<br>
MR. W.      Oh horrible!—She's going to adore me!
     This last catastrophe is overpowering!
LADY S.     Why do you glare at one with visage lowering?
     For pity's sake recoil not thus from me!
